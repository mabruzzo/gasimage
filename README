This module nominally constructs HI images of gas clouds by under the assumption
that the gas is optically thin


Some of this was hastily thrown together. Before publishing a paper
using this code, there are few items that should be reviewed:

- check the units on the radiative transfer.

- write tests to verify the correctness of the ray intersection code

- Write additional tests verifying the correctness of the ray-rotation code:

    - I'm fairly confident that this works. (Although I'm not completely
      convinced that the plots of the rays are completely correct). some of the plots of the
I'm confident that this largely works, but I haven't tested things varying the reference ray's latitude (in the frame of the observer); so far I have just used sky_latitude = 0.0).
