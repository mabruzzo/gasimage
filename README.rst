``gasimage`` is an experimental python package for post-processing hydrodynamic simulations to produce mock observations of gas.

This module was primarily designed to produce mock position-position-velocity cubes of 21 cm HI gas (under the assumption of optically thin radiative transfer).
The underlying design can be extended to other regimes.
